Flying has been the go-to mode of travel for years now; it is time-saving, affordable, and extremely convenient. According to the FAA, 2,781,971 passengers fly every day in the US, as in June 2019. Passengers reckon that flying is very safe, considering strict inspections are conducted and security measures are taken to avoid and/or mitigate any mishappenings. However, there remain a few chances of unfortunate incidents.

We are required to build Machine Learning models to anticipate and classify the severity of any airplane accident based on past incidents. With this, all airlines, even the entire aviation industry, can predict the severity of airplane accidents caused due to various factors and, correspondingly, have a plan of action to minimize the risk associated with them.

### Dataset 
The dataset is supplied in the [HackerEarth Competition](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/competitive/airplane-accident-severity-hackerearth-machine-learning-),to find severity of a accidents
### Installation
You need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib.pyplot
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

### File Description
The csv file is downloaded from HackerEarth. The jupyter notebook file contains codes of data preprocessing, data visualizations and a model prediciton of Severity of an airplane accident.
